# Dragon Archiver

Dragon Archiver is a world creation and note-taking tool for tabletop role-playing games aimed at Games Master, Players, and even Historians!

DragonArchiver aims to enable both Game Masters and Players to understand better the worlds they interact in and promote more long-term freedom in managing knowledge far better than what was possible with pen and paper.
