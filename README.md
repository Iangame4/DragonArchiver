# Dragon Archiver

Dragon Archiver is a world creation and note taking tool for tabletop role playing games aimed at Games Master, Players, and even Historians!

The aim of DragonArchiver is to enable both Game Masters and Players the ability to better understand the worlds they interact in and to enable more long term freedom in managing knowledge far better than what was possible with pen and paper.

## How to Engage, Contribute, and Give Feedback
This project is still extremely brand new and we still have quite some distance to go before I would considered us truly Pre-Aplha. As such a lot of documentation will be incomplete or have incorrect information. As such take everything in the documentation with a grain of salt and view them more as a guide than a rule.

Some of the best ways to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) are to try things out, file issues, join in design conversations,
and make pull-requests. Proposals for changes specific to the Dragon Archiver can be found [here for discussion](https://github.com/WizWorksInc/DragonArchiver/issues).
