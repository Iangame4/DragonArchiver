# Development Guide (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Dragon Archiver is built using .Net Maui and closely adheres to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This allows us to decouple our application so that extensibility is easier in the long run. As such you are expected to adhere to this design principle also at all times. Failure to file this architecture could possibly lead to any PR made to the repo to be declined. So please adhere!
If you need any help on the topic feel free to ask questions!
## Building

1. Fork the `dev` branch as a personal repository.
