Dragon Archiver is a world creation and note taking tool for tabletop role playing games aimed at Games Master, Players, and even Historians!

The aim of DragonArchiver is to enable both Game Masters and Players the ability to better understand the worlds they interact in and to enable more long term freedom in managing knowledge far better than what was possible with pen and paper.
